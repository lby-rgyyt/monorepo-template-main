# Use Case 2

<hr>

**Use Case**: Change color

**Primary Actor**: User

**Goal in Context**: To change colors to draw on the canvas

**Preconditions**: There must be an existing canvas and in a responsive state

**Trigger**: Press the number keys 1 through 8
  
**Scenario**: A user will press number keys 1 through 8 to change different colors they want to draw.
 
**Exceptions**: The program may become potentially unresponsive. In this case, the program can be terminated from the operating system.

**Priority**: Medium-priority

**When available**: Second release

**Channel to actor**: The primary actor communicates through I/O devices. This includes the keyboard. The system is responsible for maintaining focus of the window when the user press number keys, and should respond within 1 second of pressing number keys event. The user is responsible for all other input.

**Secondary Actor**: N/A

**Channels to Secondary Actors**: N/A

**Open Issues**: We might need to add more colors for users to choose in the future, and add a palette to let users adjust colors.
